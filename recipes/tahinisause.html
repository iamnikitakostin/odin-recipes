    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The BEST authentic tahini sauce recipe with garlic, lime juice and fresh parsley! Be sure to watch my video and grab my tips below. This rich, flavor-packed vegan sauce is popular throughout the Mediterranean and the Middle East, and it can elevate any meal from kabobs to falafel sandwiches and everything in between. Perfect served as part of mezze with some warm pita and fresh veggies too!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <li>
        <ul>1-2 garlic cloves</ul>
        <ul>½ tsp salt</ul>
        <ul>¾ cup tahini paste</ul>
        <ul>½ cup freshly squeezed lime juice (or lemon juice, if you prefer)</ul>
        <ul>¼ cup cold water, more if needed</ul>
        <ul>1 cup fresh chopped parsley leaves, stems removed first (optional)</ul>
    </li>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <li>
        <ol>Using a mortar and pestle, crush the garlic cloves with the salt into a paste (or mince the garlic and season with salt.)</ol>
        <ol>Add the crushed garlic, tahini paste and lime juice to the bowl of a food processor and blend (it will be thick as it emulsifies.) Add a little bit of water and blend again until you reach the desired consistency.</ol>
        <ol>Transfer the tahini to a serving bowl, and if you like stir in fresh chopped parsley. Enjoy!</ol>
    </li>
